# AutoManip
This project focuses on developing an autonomous robotic system that recognizes and manipulates objects using reinforcement learning (RL). The system is designed to be modular using ROS2 for robotics integration, OpenCV for object recognition, and RL algorithms for decision-making and task optimization.
