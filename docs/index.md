# Autonomous Object Manipulation Project

This project focuses on developing an autonomous robotic system capable of recognizing and manipulating objects using ROS 2, OpenCV, and reinforcement learning. The system is designed to be modular and adaptable to various object manipulation tasks in a simulated environment.

## Key Features

* **Object Recognition:** Real-time object classification using OpenCV.
* **Reinforcement Learning:** Autonomous learning of manipulation strategies using RL algorithms.
* **ROS 2 Integration:** Modular design and communication using the Robot Operating System 2.
* **Simulation Environment:** Development and testing in a realistic 3D environment using Gazebo.
