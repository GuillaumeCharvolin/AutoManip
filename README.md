# Autonomous Object Manipulation with ROS2, OpenCV, and Reinforcement Learning

This project focuses on developing an autonomous robotic system that recognizes and manipulates objects using reinforcement learning (RL). The system is designed to be modular using ROS2 for robotics integration, OpenCV for object recognition, and RL algorithms for decision-making and task optimization.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to train a robotic system to autonomously recognize and manipulate objects in a simulated environment. Using a camera mounted on the robot, OpenCV is employed for image processing, while reinforcement learning enables the robot to optimize its actions in object manipulation tasks.

### Key Components:
1. **Object Recognition**: 
   - Use OpenCV for image processing and real-time object classification.
   - The system will identify various objects in the environment based on visual data from the robotâ€™s camera.

2. **Reinforcement Learning for Manipulation**: 
   - Implement RL algorithms such as Q-learning or Deep Q Networks (DQN) to allow the robot to learn optimal manipulation strategies.
   - The robot will learn through trial and error, with feedback provided via a reward system.

3. **Simulation Environment**: 
   - The project is developed and tested in a simulated environment using ROS2 and Gazebo.
   - Various scenarios such as object placement and robot movement are simulated to ensure that the robot can adapt to different situations.

## Technologies Used
- **ROS2**: For robotic control and system communication.
- **OpenCV**: For real-time object detection and image processing.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: For developing decision-making algorithms.
- **Gazebo**: (optional) For 3D simulation of the robotic system.
- **Python & C++**: Programming languages for developing algorithms and interfacing with ROS2.
